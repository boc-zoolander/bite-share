### Introduction
This was a month long student project where our team completed an MVP full stack application requested by a "client".

Time to pay up. The meal has ended and the waiter/waitress asks "separate or together?" obviously hoping for the ladder. With Bite Share, the answer can confidently be "together" with no worried thoughts about the aftermath. No more tracking everyone down, pulling out calculators, or passing bills around to make proper change.

Bite Share allows its users to select their favorite restaurant, invite their friends or colleagues to a meal session, have everyone enter their order, total the bill, add tip, calculate tax, split evenly or by item, and route to payment all in one app.

Enjoy the food. Enjoy the company. End the meal on a high note with Bite Share.
