### Introduction
This was a month long project where our team completed an MVP full stack application for an external user (Jane Doe)

Add any additional content here pertaining to the timeline, any personal goals, etc.
What does the app do?
* What problem does it solve? Who uses it?
* Why was it built?
* User Inputs and Outputs
*
### Tech stack ( you can include logos)
* React + React Router
* Bootstrap, Normalize CSS + Skeleton CSS
* JQuery
* Axios
* Express
* PostgreSQL
* Socket.io
* Jest, React Testing Library + Enzyme
* APIs: Documenu, Tax + and Paypal

### Technical Challenges and research that you anticipated
* Why, what was the plan to overcome those challenges?
* What did you learn?
* Real time app notification
  * Trying to find a technology that allowed for two-way interactive communication without the use of GET requests.
  * I learned about socket.io. This allowed for real time app interactions between users without the need for refreshing a page. I learned that data, notifications, almost anything can be shared or initiated by using socket.ioâ€™s listening and emit features. Additionally, with the use of a rooms feature you can limit the audience by a unique room identifier.  
### Challenges that were unexpected
* Why was it a challenge
* What did you learn?
### Video Demo / Screen shot walkthrough of the app
* What were the user stories /  what was MVP (mention Minimal Viable Product)
### How does the app work?
* What happens behind the scenes when the user interacts with it?
* OR What are all the places the data travels?  What happens to that data?
* Optionally include a diagram
* How does the tech stack come together?
### What research was required?
### Workflow and Key lessons from your team - specifically those related to: Agile, CI/CD, testing, working with external stakeholders, ticketing, and user stories.
* Your git workflow, style guides, commit guides, etc
* What did you learn from the process
* What were key takeaways from stand ups, code reviews, etc
* Writing tests
* Link to your project board, discuss completed tickets
### Any non-MVP tickets (optional)
### Code refactorings
### Performance Optimizations
### Additional features
####etc
### Notes from your Sprint Retro
### What additional features do you plan to add, how do you plan to implement those features?
* Future refactoring?
* Additional dev ops considerations?
* UI/UX additions?
