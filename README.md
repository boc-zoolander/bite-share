### Introduction
This was a month long project where our team completed an MVP full stack application for an external user (Jane Doe)

Add any additional content here pertaining to the timeline, any personal goals, etc.
What does the app do?
* What problem does it solve? Who uses it?
* Why was it built?
* User Inputs and Outputs

### Tech stack ( you can include logos)
* React + React Router
* Bootstrap, Normalize CSS + Skeleton CSS
* JQuery
* Axios
* Express
* PostgreSQL
* Socket.io
* Jest, React Testing Library + Enzyme
* CircleCI
* APIs: Documenu, Tax + and Paypal

### Technical Challenges and research that you anticipated
* Why, what was the plan to overcome those challenges?
* What did you learn?

### Challenges that were unexpected
* Why was it a challenge
* What did you learn?

### Video Demo / Screen shot walkthrough of the app
* What were the user stories /  what was MVP (mention Minimal Viable Product)

### How does the app work?
* What happens behind the scenes when the user interacts with it?
* OR What are all the places the data travels?  What happens to that data?
* Optionally include a diagram
* How does the tech stack come together?

### What research was required?

### Workflow and Key Lessons
#### Git Workflow
* After creating the initial skeleton of the app, everyone pulled down the repo and completed their work in separate branches
* Commit as often as possible, and make a pull request when the functionality being worked on works as expected locally
* Request 2 code reviewers for every PR - after both approve, the branch should be merged with the main branch and deleted
* When changes are requested, the person who made the pull request should make the changes, discuss with reviewer(s) and decide when the branch can be merged

#### Tests
* We primarily leveraged Jest + React Testing Library to test our application
* Our goal was to follow a test-driven development approach, but we weren't always able to keep up a rigid workflow around that
* We had some basic tests written which were tested with every push to the repo via CircleCI

#### Key Takeaways
* Getting more tests written early on: we sacrificed writing tests early to quickly develop an MVP to reach client goals
* Establishing more clear guidelines around time expectations for code reviews
* Improve our time estimates for tickets, and better managaement of tickets as they change status
* Look into Github Actions for continuous integration to be used instead of CircleCI
* Consistent and honest code reviews to keep our code clean and DRY (remove console.logs, comments, and make code as re-usable and readable as possible)

### Any non-MVP tickets (optional)
### Code refactorings
### Performance Optimizations
### Additional features

### Notes from your Sprint Retro
### What additional features do you plan to add, how do you plan to implement those features?
* Future refactoring?
* Additional dev ops considerations?
* UI/UX additions?
